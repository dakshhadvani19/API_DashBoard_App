# API_DashBoard_App
It's an modern Multi-API Dashboard App which supports user to search within Different Types of APIs with Failed Request history . It is made by only FrontEnd ( Vanila JS , Tailwind CSS ) .
I built this just to check and implement my all FrontEnd Skills in order to preparing for FAANG.
So i also consider most of Edge Cases and just added some functionalties that really bring and test my patience and skills completely . 
It is not just about searching through API , it also handles Ashynchronus Programming and features very well without major bugs and also tried make UI as good as possible with smart Use of classes of Tailwind CSS . 
Used some very usefull features of JS like Object Mapping and Smart keydown functionalities with also restricting the Developer tools and other things which is good for an app which is just built on JS so keep it secured .
